    "Objective: The aim of this exercise was to test whether GPT-3.5-Turbo can determine the relevant tables for constructing SQL queries based on table names and their definitions. This involved feeding the model with structured prompts and evaluating its responses.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "1.\tEffective Scenarios:\n",
    "o\tWhen table names and definitions were detailed and directly aligned with the user’s query, the model performed well, accurately identifying the necessary tables.\n",
    "o\tClear and concise prompts, formatted with structured instructions, yielded accurate and consistent outputs.\n",
    "o\tIn a challenging example where employees needed to be matched with their highest educational degree obtained in the same year they were hired, the model successfully identified only the relevant tables (employees, studies, and departments), demonstrating its ability to handle more complex and ambiguous queries.\n",
    "o\tFor a more ambiguous query (\"Who has achieved the highest educational level and is associated with the highest total salary in their department?\"), the model inferred the correct set of tables (employees, departments, studies, salaries), showing that the optimized prompt improved its ability to handle unclear questions.\n",
    "2.\tChallenging Scenarios:\n",
    "o\tHallucinations: In cases where table definitions were ambiguous or overlapped conceptually, GPT occasionally inferred irrelevant tables or omitted necessary ones.\n",
    "o\tOver-inclusion of Tables: Even when the user’s question was specific and did not require certain tables (e.g., salaries in creative variations), the model included them in the response.\n",
    "o\tOmission of Tables: For questions that involved filtering by department (e.g., \"Which employees with a PhD earned more than $90,000 last year in the 'Research' department?\"), the model failed to include the departments table. This suggests a lack of understanding of inter-table dependencies.\n",
    "o\tSensitivity to Prompt Wording: Minor changes in the question phrasing led to inconsistencies, with the model sometimes overcompensating by adding unnecessary tables.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Key Learnings:\n",
    "•\tPrompt Design Matters: A well-structured prompt, including explicit formatting, clear task delineation, and examples of relationships, is critical for obtaining accurate responses.\n",
    "•\tContextual Ambiguity: The model relies heavily on explicit definitions; vague or incomplete descriptions significantly impact accuracy.\n",
    "•\tIterative Refinement: Experimenting with variations of the same query can help identify optimal approaches and refine results.\n",
    "•\tDependency Clarity: Explicitly stating dependencies between tables in the prompt can help guide the model to better decisions.\n",
    "•\tHandling Ambiguity: Optimized prompts with detailed instructions improved the model’s ability to infer relationships, even when the query was unclear or incomplete.\n",
    "•\tLimitations of AI: While GPT is powerful in text understanding, it lacks inherent relational database knowledge, leading to occasional logical gaps.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Future Considerations:\n",
    "•\tEnhance table definitions with unambiguous and context-rich descriptions.\n",
    "•\tInclude contextual examples in the prompt to guide the model effectively.\n",
    "•\tValidate model outputs by cross-referencing with actual database schemas to mitigate hallucinations.\n",
    "•\tExplore fine-tuning for domain-specific database tasks to improve precision and reliability.\n",

    "Conclusion: \n",
    "This exercise highlighted GPT-3.5-Turbo’s potential as a tool for SQL query assistance but underscored the importance of prompt engineering and validation processes. The optimized prompt significantly improved the model’s ability to infer relationships, handle ambiguity, and provide accurate table selections. While the model demonstrated strong capabilities, certain scenarios require human intervention or additional refinement to ensure accuracy.\n"

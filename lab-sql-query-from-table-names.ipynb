    "# Report on Using GPT-3.5-Turbo for SQL Table Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the capability of GPT-3.5-Turbo to determine the necessary SQL tables to query based on user questions. We provided the model with table names and their definitions and asked it to identify the relevant tables for specific queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "We tested the model with two different questions:\n",
    "1. \"What is the department with the highest number of employees?\"\n",
    "2. \"What is the department with the highest paid employees?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "For the first question, the model correctly identified the necessary tables:\n",
    "- `employees`\n",
    "- `dept_emp`\n",
    "- `departments`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second question, the model also correctly identified the necessary tables:\n",
    "- `employees`\n",
    "- `salaries`\n",
    "- `departments`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variations and Issues\n",
    "While the model performed well in these instances, there were some variations where the model either hallucinated or provided incorrect table selections. For example:\n",
    "- When the question was ambiguous or not well-defined, the model sometimes included irrelevant tables.\n",
    "- In some cases, the model missed essential tables that were required to answer the query accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "1. **Context Matters**: The quality of the input context significantly affects the model's performance. Clear and concise table definitions and user questions lead to better results.\n",
    "2. **Model Limitations**: GPT-3.5-Turbo, while powerful, is not infallible. It can sometimes hallucinate or provide incorrect answers, especially with ambiguous queries.\n",
    "3. **Human Oversight**: It is essential to have human oversight to verify the model's output, especially in critical applications like database querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "GPT-3.5-Turbo shows promise in assisting with SQL table selection based on user queries. However, it is crucial to provide clear input and verify the model's output to ensure accuracy. Further testing and refinement can help improve its reliability in real-world applications."

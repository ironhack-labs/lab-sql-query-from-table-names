    "Initial Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially provided the GPT model with several table names related to travel (e.g., \"Clothes,\" \"Documentation,\" \"Vaccines,\" \"Tickets,\" \"Accessories,\" \"Insurances\") along with their descriptions.\n",
    "The model did not performed well in recognizing which tables were relevant to the user’s question when asked about organizing a world trip. The returned tables did not make sense based on the context provided (e.g., returning \"Clothes\" and \"Accessories\" for packing-related queries). It returned for example the Groceries Shopping List for the Week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refined the prompt to broaden the scope of the query, such as asking about preparing for a year-long trip. The model still showed unessential columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked to expand the columns for each table to ensure nothing was missing, the model initially did not add any new columns or expand upon the current table structure.\n",
    "A refined prompt asking for additional columns and their data types did not yield the desired result. This shows that the model sometimes struggles with creative schema generation when not explicitly guided with examples or more structured prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Specificity is Key: GPT performs best when prompts are detailed and structured. If the question is too vague, the model may provide incomplete or shallow responses.\n",
    "Limitations of Schema Generation: While GPT can understand and work with provided tables, it struggles with independently generating new and creative additions to schemas without structured guidance.\n"

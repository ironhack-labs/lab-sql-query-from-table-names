    "Overview:\n",
    "In this exercise, I experimented with GPT-3.5 to determine if it could correctly identify which tables from a database are necessary to answer various SQL queries. The tables, along with their descriptions, were passed to the model, and the model was tasked with selecting which tables were required to answer the user's questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations Tested:\n",
    "Retrieving customer orders and payment details: This query asked for customer orders along with payment details, so I expected the model to correctly select the orders and payments tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving product sales information: This query requested product details along with sales information, so the orders and products tables were relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer order history: This query required both customers and orders tables to join customer details with their order history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "The model was able to correctly identify the necessary tables in all the tested queries. Here are some observations for each test case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Orders and Payment Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model correctly responded that both the orders and payments tables were needed for this query, as the orders table holds customer order details and the payments table has related payment information.\n",
    "Product Sales in the Last 30 Days:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model correctly identified that both the orders and products tables were required. The products table contains product details, while the orders table stores information about the time of the sale.\n",
    "Customer and Order Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, the model selected the customers and orders tables because these two tables are required to link customers with their respective orders.\n",
    "Successes:\n",
    "Correct Table Selection: The model consistently selected the correct tables based on the user query and the table definitions provided.\n",
    "Efficient JSON Output: The use of JSON format in the model’s response makes it easy to programmatically process the output for further use, such as building SQL queries dynamically.\n",
    "Challenges and Issues:\n",
    "Ambiguous Questions: If the query was vague, the model sometimes picked additional, unnecessary tables. For example, if the query didn't explicitly mention payments but was related to customer orders, the model sometimes included the payments table just to be safe.\n",
    "Short Descriptions: The definitions of the tables had to be clear and specific. When the definitions were too brief or abstract, the model had difficulty determining the correct tables. This suggests that the quality of the table descriptions directly influences the model’s accuracy.\n",
    "What I Learned:\n",
    "Model's Dependency on Table Definitions: The success of the table selection task heavily depends on the quality of the table definitions. More detailed and specific definitions led to more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Hallucination: In rare cases, when the query was too vague, the model added unnecessary tables to the results. This suggests that it's important to write clear, focused questions when working with models like GPT-3.5 for SQL table selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-Tuning SQL Table Selection: This type of task could be further improved by fine-tuning GPT-3.5 or using a specific set of prompt engineering techniques, such as adding negative examples (e.g., tables that shouldn’t be included) to help guide the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, GPT-3.5 can be quite effective in helping identify the necessary tables for SQL queries based on table names and definitions. However, it’s crucial to provide clear, detailed definitions and ask well-defined questions to minimize errors."

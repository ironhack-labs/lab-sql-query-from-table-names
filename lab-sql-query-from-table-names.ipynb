    "### Overview of GPT's Table Selection Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial vs Improved Prompting\n",
    "The study revealed that the quality of prompts significantly impacts GPT's ability to identify correct table relationships. After adding explicit relationship guidance in the prompt, the model's performance improved notably.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Cases and Results\n",
    "1. **Basic Queries**\n",
    "   - \"What is the average salary of all employees?\"\n",
    "   - Tables selected: employees, salary\n",
    "   - Result: Correct selection with both prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education-Only Queries**\n",
    "   - \"Which employees have a GPA above 3.5?\"\n",
    "   - Tables selected: employees, studies\n",
    "   - Result: Correct selection with both prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Joined Queries**\n",
    "   - \"What is the average salary of employees who have a master's degree?\"\n",
    "   - Initial Result:  Missed 'studies' table (only selected employees, salary)\n",
    "   - Improved Result: Correctly identified all three tables needed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Complex Queries**\n",
    "   - \"Average bonus for employees with Computer Science degree making above $100,000\"\n",
    "   - Result: Correctly identified all three tables needed\n",
    "   - Shows improvement in handling multi-condition queries\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal Analysis**\n",
    "   - \"Salary increases > 10% between 2022-2023\"\n",
    "   - Result: Correctly identified employees and salary tables\n",
    "   - Demonstrates understanding of historical data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Worked Well\n",
    "1. **Explicit Relationship Guidance**\n",
    "   - Adding clear table relationship rules significantly improved accuracy\n",
    "   - Model better understood implicit joins needed for complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Queries**\n",
    "   - Consistently accurate for straightforward single-table queries\n",
    "   - Reliable for direct two-table relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pattern Recognition**\n",
    "   - Successfully identified salary-related patterns requiring both employees and salary tables\n",
    "   - Recognized education-related queries needing studies table access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Areas for Improvement\n",
    "1. **Complex Relationships**\n",
    "   - Initial prompt struggled with queries requiring three-table joins\n",
    "   - Required explicit guidance about table relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Context**\n",
    "   - Model sometimes missed implicit requirements without clear prompting\n",
    "   - Benefits from explicit rules about table usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons Learned\n",
    "1. **Prompt Engineering Matters**\n",
    "   - Clear relationship guidelines significantly improve accuracy\n",
    "   - Explicit rules help prevent missing necessary tables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Capabilities**\n",
    "   - GPT-3.5 can reliably identify table requirements when properly guided\n",
    "   - Performance depends heavily on prompt quality and explicitness\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Practices**\n",
    "   - Include relationship rules in prompts\n",
    "   - Specify common query patterns\n",
    "   - Make implicit relationships explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. Always include table relationship guidelines in prompts\n",
    "2. Specify common query patterns that require multiple tables\n",
    "3. Test complex queries to verify relationship understanding\n",
    "4. Consider adding metadata about foreign key relationships\n",
    "5. Regular validation of results for complex queries"
